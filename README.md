# Data structure and algorithm examples

This repository contains examples of data structures in the `my_collections` module, so far 

- Double Circlar Linked List `DoubleCircularLinkedList`

- stack that uses `DoubleCircularLinkedList`

- queue that uses `DoubleCircularLinkedList`

I do plan on adding more as the semester goes on if I have time, and also adding some algorithms too.
